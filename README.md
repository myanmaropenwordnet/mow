# Myanmar Open Wordnet (MOW) Repository
This is the official repository for Myanmar Open Wordnet (MOW). At present, it's just a convenient place to download releases, which are tab-separated files (.tab format). The .tab files are named as such: ``mow-<version>-mya_<datetime:yyyymmddhhmmss>.tab``

(At present there is only one release. In future, the latest release will be in the top directory, while older releases will be kept in the "Previous Releases" folder)
